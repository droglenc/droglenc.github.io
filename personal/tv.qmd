# Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives
Kim and I appeared, with speaking "parts", on *Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives when Guy visited the [Delta Diner](https://deltadiner.com/), an amazing restaurant near our home.

# Travel Wisconsin
I also had a cameo on a *Travel Wisconsin* piece about [Big Top Chautauqua](https://www.bigtop.org/). Unfortunately it looks like the piece is no long available, which is OK, because for some reason they focused most clips of my wife and her family.

# HS Basketball at Carver-Hawkeye
I was part of the Linn-Mar team that played the [only high school basketball game at the University of Iowa's Carver-Hawkeye Arena](https://www.kcrg.com/2022/01/26/look-back-only-high-school-basketball-game-ever-played-carver-hawkeye-arena/). If you look closely in some of these clips you can see that I had a good seat for the action!
