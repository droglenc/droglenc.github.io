title: Having Fun!
---

When I am not working, I very much enjoy spending time with my wife Kim and our sheltie Cash (and previous dogs Jem and Jordan). In addition, I enjoy tending to our property on the Muskeg Creek; fishing, boating, and underwater photography in the summer; and cross-country skiing in the winter.  I also dig the blues and the music of JJ Grey, Michael Franti, and Corey Carlson.

Not surprisingly, I also make occasional TV appearances.  The most famous of these is my appearance on **Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives**.

I also had a cameo on [this Travel Wisconsin piece about Big Top Chautauqua](http://www.travelwisconsin.com/media-gallery/media/a-night-at-big-top-chautauqua-concert-under-a-tent-music-in-wisconsin-170539).  For some reason, they used mostly clips of my wife and her family.
