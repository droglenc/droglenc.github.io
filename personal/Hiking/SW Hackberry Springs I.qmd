title: "Hackberry Springs Loop"
---

On February 24, 2023 Kim and I hiked the Hackberry Springs loop (from the First Water TH) on a beautiful sunny day. This loop was one of the first hikes we did five or so years ago. At that time we had very little experience and were navigating with a small map in a dated book. We completed the hike then but it was much more comfortable this time as we had more experience hiking in the desert and were using our Avenza. This is quite a beautiful trail, especially on the way down to and out of Hackberry Springs. My favorite part is the high bluffs along the stream.
