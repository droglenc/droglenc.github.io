# Superstition Wilderness Hiking
![](../../zresources/img/SWhiking1.webp){fig-align="center"}

Kim's Mom has a place near Superstition Mountain which we try to visit annually. In 2022 I started mapping hikes that we made in the Superstition Wilderness. Those hikes are shown below. More information on some specific walks is in the next section.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

project <- "Superstition Wilderness"

## Run following two lines if new tracks have been added since last update
#source("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Scripts/dataPrepHelper.R")
#dat <- dataPrepHelper(project=project,basedir="c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/")

# Make vector of colors for Iron River Area
clrs <- c("2022"="#CC0000","2023"="#CC6600")

# Read in CSV file will all track info needed for the map
trkdat <- read.csv(paste0("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Data/",project,"_trkdat.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| label: makeMap
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 7
#| fig.height: 7
gpxhelpers::allTracksMap(trkdat,clrs=clrs,verbose=FALSE)
```
