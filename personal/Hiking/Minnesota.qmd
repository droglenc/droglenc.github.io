![](../../zresources/img/MNhiking.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Kim and I often go to Minnesota for long weekend vacations. We primarily hike and eat good food and drink craft beer on these trips. Below are some of our hikes.

project <- "Minnesota"

## Run following two lines if new tracks have been added since last update
#source("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Scripts/dataPrepHelper.R")
#dat <- dataPrepHelper(project=project,basedir="c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING")

# Make vector of colors for Iowa
clrs <- c("Highway"="#CC0000","Paved"="#336666",
          "Gravel"="#CC6600","Offroad"="#CC9900",
          "Trail"="#999933", "ATV"="#663300")

# Read in CSV file will all track info needed for the map
trkdat <- read.csv(paste0("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Data/",project,"_trkdat.csv"))
