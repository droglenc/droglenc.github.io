title: "Paper Mill Trail and Whiting Park Loop"
subtitle: "Stevens Point, WI"
---

[Cash](../shelties.html#cash) and I were in Stevens Point to pick up a part for the boat. For a break we hiked the Paper Mill Trail of the [Green Circle Trail]() and looped around Whiting Park. The Paper Mill Trail was fairly flat and well-maintained. It provide nice views of the river and was quite nice, besides a short section that felt very (old) industrial. The loop in the park was very nice and a little more "rugged" (less-maintained), with the only down-side needing to walk along Water St to make the loop. All-in-all this was a nice hike for a break.
