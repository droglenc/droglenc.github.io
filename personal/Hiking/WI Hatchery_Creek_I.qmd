title: "Hatchery Creek Trail I"
subtitle: "Hayward, WI"

[Cash](../shelties.html#cash) and I made a quick loop in the Hatchery Creek system of trails just outside of Hayward when we were traveling south in Fall 2025. The rolling and upland woods trail was quite pretty with a decent amount of relief. I think much of the trail was a bike trail so some of the switchbacks were getting kind of old. However, all-in-all a nice hike.
