# Iron River Area Hiking
![](../../zresources/img/IRhiking1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

For exercise and for getting to know the area in which I have lived for the last three decades, [Cash](../shelties.html#cash) and I have been walking many of the roads and back-country trails in the [Iron River](https://visitironriver.com/) WI area. Below are the places we have walked thusfar. Some specific walks are highlighted in the next section.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
#| out.width: 90%

project <- "Iron River Area"

## Run following two lines if new tracks have been added since last update
#source("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Scripts/dataPrepHelper.R")
#dat <- dataPrepHelper(project=project,basedir="c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING")

# Make vector of colors for Iron River Area
clrs <- c("Highway"="#CC0000","Paved"="#336666",
          "Gravel"="#CC6600","Offroad"="#CC9900",
          "Trail"="#999933", "ATV"="#663300")

# Read in CSV file will all track info needed for the map
trkdat <- read.csv(paste0("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Data/",project,"_trkdat.csv"))
```

```{r}
#| label: makeMap
#| echo: false
#| fig.width: 7
#| fig.height: 7
#| fig.cap: "Hello"
gpxhelpers::allTracksMap(trkdat,clrs=clrs,verbose=FALSE)
```
