# Iowa Hiking
![](../../zresources/img/IAhiking1.webp){fig-align="center"}

I was born and raised in Iowa. When I return home now to see family, we try to explore some of the beautiful areas in Northeast (and some in East) Iowa. Below are some of our hikes.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
#| out.width: 90%

project <- "Iowa"

## Run following two lines if new tracks have been added since last update
#source("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Scripts/dataPrepHelper.R")
#dat <- dataPrepHelper(project=project,basedir="c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING")

# Make vector of colors for Iowa
clrs <- c("Highway"="#CC0000","Paved"="#336666",
          "Gravel"="#CC6600","Offroad"="#CC9900",
          "Trail"="#999933", "ATV"="#663300")

# Read in CSV file will all track info needed for the map
trkdat <- read.csv(paste0("c:/aaaPersonal/MAPPING/Data/",project,"_trkdat.csv"))
```
