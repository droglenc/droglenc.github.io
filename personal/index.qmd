My wife Kim and I particularly like to travel and take walks with our sheltie *Cash* (as we did with *Jem* and *Jordan*). I also tend to our Oulu property, fish, boat, cross-country ski, snowshoe, attend live music, and smoke fish and meat. I also make occasional TV appearances, the most famous of these is my appearance on **Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives**.
