Kim and I enjoy all kinds of live music, particularly at [Big Top Chautauqua](https://www.bigtop.org/), which is only an hour from home. I primarily listen to blues-rock (think [SRV](https://www.srvofficial.com/), [KWS](https://kennywayneshepherd.net/), etc) and outlaw country ([Waylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waylon_Jennings), [Willie](https://willienelson.com/), etc.) but we have been know to travel good distances to see [Michael Franti](https://michaelfranti.com/), [JJ Grey & Mofro](https://www.jjgrey.com/), [Ronnie Baker Brooks](https://ronniebakerbrooks.com/), and [Corey Carlson](https://www.facebook.com/people/Corey-Carlson/100063657092922/).
