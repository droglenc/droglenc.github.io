I very much enjoy spending time with my wife Kim and our [sheltie Cash (and previous shelties Jem and Jordan](shelties.html)). In addition, I enjoy tending to our property on the [Muskeg Creek](muskeg.html); [fishing](fishing.html), boating, and underwater photography in the summer; and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter. I also enjoy listening to [music](music.html) and [podcasts](podcasts.html).

Since getting an iPhone and Cash, I have also done a lot of hiking/walking followed by [mapping our hikes/walks](hiking.html).

Not surprisingly, I also make occasional [TV appearances](tv.html); the most famous of these is my appearance on **Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives**.
