Jem was our [sheltie](http://www.wisheltierescue.com/) who graced our lives from April(ish) 2009 to almost August 2018. Many people knew Jem from seeing him around the Science Center during the school year. Jem was such a special dog ... very smart, incredibly loyal, and always watching over and protecting us. While he was a little snooty and often turned up his nose at “strangers”, he also melted your heart if he decided to give you the time of day. [Here is a short piece that I wrote about Jem](http://sheltiespandp.weebly.com/jem.html) a few years ago.

Jem was taken from us way too early, though we know he is now with his ["grandpa owner"](http://www.apg-wi.com/ashland_daily_press/obituaries/lloyd-sellung/article_f4167abc-1e92-11e8-87a0-17b0ec3869f9.html) taking walks, sitting on the couch together, and scheming to get those chippies. RIP "poundy", I wish we would have had more time together, you were such a special little guy!! We will [see you again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj37_Rqsec4) (*Thanks [Ronnie](http://www.ronniebakerbrooks.com/) ... beautiful song*).
