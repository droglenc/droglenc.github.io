I also enjoy listening to music and podcasts.\nSince getting an iPhone and Cash, I have also done a lot of hiking/walking followed by mapping our hikes/walks.\nNot surprisingly, I also make occasional TV appearances; the most famous of these is my appearance on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."

Jem was such a special dog … very smart, incredibly loyal, and always watching over and protecting us. While he was a little snooty and often turned up his nose at “strangers”, he also melted your heart if he decided to give you the time of day. Here is a short piece that I wrote about Jem a few years ago.\nJem was taken from us way too early, though we know he is now with his “grandpa owner” taking walks, sitting on the couch together, and scheming to get those chippies. RIP “poundy”, I wish we would have had more time together, you were such a special little guy!! We will see you again (Thanks Ronnie … beautiful song)."
