    "text": "Recently I have been considering the relative costs of propane and wood for heating our house. One of the considerations for propane is how the cost fluctuates from year-to-year and within a year. Most propane companies offer a “lock-in” price to protect against the supposedly inevitable increase in the cost of propane during the winter. I questioned whether this was a good investment or not (like many things, I suspected it was better for the propane company than me).\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has a website that shows the price per gallon of propane in Mont Belvieu, TX, as well as the wholesale and residential prices of propane during the heating season for a variety of regions and states. Both pages provide an option to download the data, which I did to play with below.\nFigure 1: My propane tank."

My thought was supported in years like 2016-17 and 2020-21, but was not supported in many other years.

    "text": "The winter of 2022-23 was exceptionally snowy in northern Wisconsin (see this). Landowners around the Pike Lake Chain expressed concerns about high water levels on the lakes soon after ice-out that year as “beaches” and docks were under water. A relative depth gauge is affixed to a permanent “wall” a few feet upstream from the dam on Flynn Lake (i.e., the outlet of the Pike Lake Chain). With the help of some friends (see Acknowledgments below), I now have near daily water level measurements at the gauge from May 2, 2023 to March 15, 2025. I hope these data will help us better understand both typical and atypical water levels on the lakes. My analysis and interpretation of these data are below. More information about the data collection is further below."

Additionally, points color coded by the amount of precipitation are shown for days where precipitation occurred (no point is shown for days without precipitation).\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily water level at Flynn Lake dam by “ice-out to ice-out season.” Points represent precipitation events since the previous observation color coded by the amount of precipitation.\n\n\n\n\nWithout historical data it is difficult to state that the water level at the beginning of 2022-23 was atypically high. However, it was nearly 5” higher than the water level at ice-out in 2023-24 and was at least 3” higher than any other water level recorded in 2022-23 after the initial peak had subsided. Furthermore, the water level dropped rather quickly in spring of 2023 suggesting that there was excess water in the system that simply needed time to be flushed out.\nFrom 2022-23, it appears that, without any additional precipitation, lake water levels drop about 1/8” to 1/4” per day until a baseline level between 21” and 22” is approached. Near that baseline the drop in lake water level tends to be less. Lake water levels can increase substantially with precipitation but the actual rise does not always match the amount of precipitation, sometimes being more and sometimes being less than the precipitation amount."

    "text": "Data Collection\nData collection is pretty straightforward for this project. I, or a friend, record the water level at the gauge to the nearest 0.01’ each day (as possible) as close to noon as possible. On the few days where we could not make the reading, I linearly interpolated the water level from the two adjacent readings. Surprisingly, it is harder to read the gauge then you would imagine. On a few days, we had multiple people read the gauge and from this I expect the “human error” of the readings to be about 0.01’.\nThe lake water level readings should be considered as “relative” values as it is not clear to me what the gauge is measuring from. In other words, a reading of 21” is not meaningful in and of itself (i.e. 21” from what?), but it does have meaning relative to another measurement of, say, 24” (i.e., it is 3” lower).\nPrecipitation measurements are from my data recorded for the CoCoRaHS Network at a location near the shore of Eagle Lake, the next lake upstream from Flynn Lake. Snow was converted to a “snow water equivalent” (SWE) to most closely compare with rain. Ice out was for Eagle Lake as recorded by Gary Hagstrom (see this)."

For example, Gary recorded ice out in 2024, a leap year, as 14-Mar but it appears as 15-Mar above to account for the extra “leap day” in Feb. In other words, 14-Mar is later in the year in a leap year then it is in a non leap year, which is accounted for above.

    "text": "On February 23, 2023 Kim and I embarked on our first walk-through hike in the Superstition Mountains. Our “support team” dropped us off at the Peralta TH about 7am when it was 45oF. It was a pretty easy hike to Fremont Saddle, which we had done before. We then dropped over the saddle and continued on the Peralta Canyon Trail past Weaver’s Needle to the Boulder Canyon Trail. It was neat to be so close to the Needle during this part of the trail. The Boulder Canyon Trail proved to be a bit challenging because the stream was fairly full of water and we had to cross it 25 times. Most crossings were pretty straight-forward, but there were several where we had to search up or downstream to find rocks close enough for both of us to cross. After our final crossing we climbed pretty steeply out of the canyon to get our first view of Canyon Lake and an awesome view back to the south of the terrain we had covered. A downhill hike to Canyon Lake Marina where our “support team” picked us up. We then went to Tortilla Flats for a beer and burger! My favorite part of this trail was seeing Weaver’s Needle from many different perspectives. All-in-all a fun trail that was 14.8 miles long and took us about 8.5 hours to complete."

    "text": "On February 15, 2024 Kim and I went for a quick in the desert on the Lost Goldmine Trail from the Broadway Ave Trailhead to the E Cloudview Ave “Trailhead.” This trail is relatively flat, provides some beautiful views of cacti, but was somewhat irritating with the many grapefruit sized rocks in the trail that made walking difficult and the many (needless?) “switchbacks” in the trail (zoom in on my track to see them). It was nice to get out for a quick hike, but we probably won’t do this one again (it is more interesting to hike up to the Broadway Cave)."

We started midday on a beautiful Saturday, so there were lots of people out. However, there were relatively few people on the “unofficial” portions of our hike. All-in-all this was a fun hike on a beautiful day (and it is always fun to see Hackberry Springs)."

    "text": "On our First day in Lauterbrunnen (October 10, 2024) we left our hotel to walk through the city and countryside to the Trummelbach waterfalls. Lauterbrunnen is stunningly beautiful sitting in deep valley with steep walls. Thus, the hike to Trummelback was jaw-dropping gorgeous in every direction. We stopped along the way to view Staubbach Falls up close, as there is a side trail passing through a tunnel that gets you in the spray of this highest (297 m) free-falling waterfall in Switzerland! From there it is a leisurely walk on roads (not busy) or trails to the entrance to Trummelbach Falls. The Trummelbach waterfalls are Europe’s largest subterranean water falls. The falls can be viewed from a number of different vantage points that are connected with underground paths, platforms, and a lift. Access to the falls was well worth the $15CHF entry fee. Following the falls we returned to the main town and our hotel using a slight different route that was less busy and mostly followed the river. This was a great hike and experience!!"

We followed the wide graveled Castle Trail out to the Walker House ruins and then circled back along the more rustic Meadow, Old Ute, and Tower trails that wrapped around a 7700’ peak and swung by the tower at Mt Falcon (at 7841’) and the Eagle Eye shelter. It was an amazing day to stretch our legs between concerts in this beautiful area."

The well-maintained wooden walkway is built into the side of the gorge. The hike through the gorge is short, but wonderful with several dramatic overhangs and sitelines that provide for great photos and movies. The views and feeling were well worth the admission price. After leaving the Gorge we had a short hike through the countryside and part of Zermatt proper to get back to our hotel.

    "text": "On February 7, 2024 Cash and I walked the Bayfield Road Hiking Trail (official map) in the Brule River State Forest. The trails are combined for the first XX miles before the trails split with the Copper Range spur splits to the right. The Copper Range trail is partially on old road, railroad, or logging trail grades at times and “deer trails” in the woods at other times. The entire trail is well-marked (almost too much) with blue paint, blue markers, and some signs. The markings are easy to see but if you get in a groove walking one of the grades you may miss the turn back into the woods. The trail ultimately ends either at the Brule River or at a parking area at the end of Park Rd. There is a bridge on Park Rd so that you can access the campground on the opposite side of the river.\nAfter hiking back on the Copper Range Spur, we turned right to follow the Bayfield Hiking trail. Very quickly we came to a short spur to look down into the mine shaft, which is cordoned off with a fence for safety. Further along the trail is another short spur to an overlook with amazing views north towards Lake Superior. The trail back to the parking area passes by an old fire tower (which could be driven to as well).\nAll-in-all a nice scenic trail through typical northern Wisconsin woods, but with some cultural attractions.\nNote that I lost satellites during this hike, so there are portions of the trail that were not mapped properly."

The views of the falls and Lake Superior are spectacular, and the trail has a little relief to it. We also enjoy the cultural display honoring the Grand Portage Ojibwe in the visitor center."

The southern border of this loop is on a fairly well-travelled forest road, whereas the other borders are on much less-traveled more off-road type forest roads. There is a power and pipe line corridor that traverses the southern third of the area, but it is not overly distracting. You can start in any of the four corners of the loop, but the NE corner is least easy to reach by truck. I started this hike in the SE corner as there is an easy parking area just across from where FR406 meets FR242. Further details are below."

    "text": "On 1-Feb-2024 Cash and I walked a loop of forest “trails” in the Barnes Barrens. Our walk began at Halfway Rd to head north on a counter-clockwise loop that crossed Moore Rd, Halfway Rd again, Moore Rd again, before ending back at Halfway Rd. Generally the “inside” of the loop appears to be being managed for a barrens habitat (logged, slash removed, and burnt) whereas the “outside” of the loop varied in habit from a typical barrens look to a mix of scrubby oak and pine to some rather larger (planted) pines. This was not an overly beautiful hike but I like the open view of the barrens landscape. We did not see Sharptail Grouse this day, but we have seen them when driving the section of Halfway Rd that bisects this hike. This hike was pretty easy walking (it could be driven with a 4WD truck). Details are below."

We accessed the trail from the Echo Valley Environmental Nature Trail and walked upstream to the Glovers Creek access parking lot. This was a nice walk along a trail that appears to be maintained for the trout stocking truck. This was a fun hike for me as I used to fish this section of stream as a kid, before the stocking truck trail was constructed. This section held many trout that had moved downstream from the stocking that (used to) stop further upstream. In fact, I caught my second largest Iowa trout in this section!

    "text": "Cash and I visited Dutton’s Cave County Park near West Union on November 28, 2024. The park has two areas, an upper part that has a small primitive campground and a lower part that is primarily a picnic area with a playground. From the parking area on the lower part we walked a well-defined trail to the base of the cave. The cave is closed to humans to protect the bats from white-nose syndrome. From there we back-tracked to the picnic area and then walked up a ravine on what looked to be a maintained trail. However, the trail soon disappeared so we followed deer trails across the ravine and along the base of a number of limestone outcrops before emerging on the road that returned to the picnic area parking lot. [Here is some history about Dutton.]"

The trail eventually disappears but I made a loop below the bluffs to where two streams come together before eventually ending on top of the bluffs for a hike back to the parking area. This was a very beautiful hike through a mature hardwood forest with a main stream and several feeder streams as well as a number of impressive limestone bluffs. The view from the “overlook” was very nice."

FR448 looks to be an old railroad grade that is typical barrens habitat for the first (western) half or so before entering an area with some nice large pines before ending (to the East) in a large area that had been recently logged. FR449 is largely in typical barrens terrain but passes a small pond and an excellent high scenic overview. FR818 is more typical barrens terrain. Overall this was a beautiful hike with pretty easy walking (it could be driven with a good 4WD truck). Details are below."

The beginning portion of the trail along the river is gorgeous with several falls and swirling plunge pools. Parts of the trail are right on the edge of the river. Upstream from all of the falls is still beautiful, just not as awe inspiring. Eventually we turned away from the river and generally walked south once the [Superior Hiking Trail]((https://superiorhiking.org/) turned north towards Carlton Peak. This portion of the trail was a very nice walk through the woods, though we were laboring some in the snow (we could have used our snow shoes). Eventually we returned to the SHT along the river where we turned back towards the parking lot. We had a very nice hike!"

The trail was moderately challenging with a bit of elevation change (including a ladder), several crossings of Bee Tree Creek (including some rope lines), and a nice stretch along the Boone Fork river. The trail was primarily wooded (so lots of welcome shade) with several waterfall views. I think that this is the first time I have hiked with my sister since we were kids and the second time with Emma (last time was in Wisconsin). Overall it was a great hike and a fun time!"

    "text": "Kim and I hiked the Hermit Trail of the Grand Canyon in Grand Canyon National Park from the rim to Santa Maria Spring on Feb 15 2024. The first third of the hike was snowy (but not too icy), but the remainder was mostly dry. The trail is more remote than the South Kaibab Trail that we did the previous day. The entire trail is beautiful but the last third after the junction with the Dripping Springs trail is especially gorgeous as it winds through a red canyon to the hut at Santa Maria Spring.\nWe were also treated along the way to a Bighorn Sheep. We initially spotted a single antler on a “shelf” about 50 feet above us. After several pictures of the antler, the sheep stood up and gave us a long and majestic side view. For some reason, the animal then quickly descended from the shelf to stop in the trail about 20’ ahead of us!! It stood there for a few minutes (as we slowly backed up) before moving across the trail to graze at the edge of a very high and sheer cliff. It was an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience.\nThis was a very fun hike!"

    "text": "On October 9, 2024, Kim and I took the Gornergrat Bahn to the Riffelberg station (8471’), hiked from there to the Gornergrat station (10132’), and took the train back to Zermatt. The hike from Riffelberg to Riffelsee was beautiful with constant and amazing views of the Matterhorn and other “lesser” mountains. There were few people on this portion of the trail, though the area around Riffelsee was busy with people walking down from the Rotenboden station. From Riffelsee we decided to take a side trail rather then walk with all of the people on the trail from Rotenboden up to Gornergrat. This was a great decision as we did not see any people after Rotenboden until we got to Gornergrat and the scenery was breathtaking. Most of this trail was fairly flat along a steep mountainside above a valley carved out by a still existing glacier. The views of the glacier were especially spectacular as we started high enough to get the perspective of the entire glacier but ended up low enough to feel the awesomeness of it. Eventually we had to climb straight up (with the help of switchbacks) the mountainside to catch the ridge trail that led back to Gornergrat. This part of the trail was challenging to both our lungs and legs, but eventually led us into fresh snow and offered views of several mountain goats. The ridge trail at the top was snow covered with amazing views in all directions. Overall, this was a highlight hike from our time in Switzerland."

The Dinosaur Ridge trail was along a closed paved road (though some buses still drove it) that lead to many “exhibits” of dinosaur bones, tracks, etc. The exhibits were interesting, though, honestly, some of them took more imagination to see than I had. The hike over to Red Rocks had some relief until the highway, after which it was fairly flat. All-in-all a fun hike, but I will probably spend my time on other trails when we return."

The trail started with a pretty steep ascent (~1100 ft) for about 1.75 miles, before leveling off on the edge of the gorge. The views back to Lake James and into the Linville Gorge were amazing (the pictures don’t do them justice). This was a great hike with the newlyweds. Thanks Dillon and Emma for the great time and spending the first few days of your new marriage with us! Can’t wait to do it again."

While we did city walks (I, II) the next day, we were itching to get into the countryside. The trail we decided on started on the edge of town fairly near our hotel and quickly climbed via several switchbacks through beautiful woods to St. Luzikapelle, a pulchritudinous little chapel in a rock grotto. From there we continued to climb until we reached an alpine meadow near Mittenberg. This area screamed “Sound of Music”, and the overlooks to the north and west were stunning. From there was a nice descent (with lots of switchbacks) back to Chur. This hike was a great introduction to the Swiss landscape, we are glad we did it."

As such we decided to save the Gornergrat hike for the next day in hopes that the clouds would clear and we could see the Matterhorn. On this day then we began a hike in Zermatt that passed through Zmutt, Zmutt See, and Blatten before looping back to Zermatt. The hike up to Zmutt was classic Switzerland through woods, alpine meadows, and rustic areas with local’s cabins, while all the while hearing the dinging of livestock bells and the murmur of distant waterfalls. The trail back after crossing the Zmuttback was initially less interesting as we were on a downhill ski run. Eventually we left that and returned to a more woodsy and pastoral trail leading to the neat little towns of Zum See (we wished the restaurant would have been open, but we were off season) and Blatten. The trail after Blatten curled through some woods before crossing the river to return to Zermatt. This was a great trail to see the Swiss landscape on a rainy day. Unfortunately, we did not take a lot of pictures because of the rain."

    "text": "On February 24, 2023 Kim and I hiked the Hackberry Springs loop (from the First Water TH) on a beautiful sunny day. This loop was one of the first hikes we did five or so years ago. At that time we had very little experience and were navigating with a small map in a dated book. We completed the hike then but it was much more comfortable this time as we had more experience hiking in the desert and were using our Avenza. This is quite a beautiful trail, especially on the way down to and out of Hackberry Springs. My favorite part is the high bluffs along the stream."

This trail is relatively flat but provides some great views of cacti as well as the sides and peaks of Turk’s Head and Superstition Ridge. The day was rainy so there were not many others on the trail. We did, however, “meet” some cattle grazing in parts of the trail that were not in the Superstition Wilderness. This was a fun hike."

The climb up the Carney Springs Canyon got my heart pumping (~1300 feet elevation gain in a little over a mile). Finding the path into Robber’s Roost was difficult, but as I got closer I could hear voices and when I met the hikers outside of the Roost they offered to show me the “secret” passage into it (Thanks, Juan). It was amazing to stand in the Roost and the views out the fractures in the wall were beautiful. I returned through Fremont Saddle (a little less than a mile from the Roost) and down the Cave Trail, which had some navigational challenges as it did last year (I did not miss Geronimo’s Cave this year, though!). This was a challenging (the climb and some route-finding), but beautiful (views from on top, the Roost) hike that I will do again (with Kim)."

    "section": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality",
    "text": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality\nAs noted in the previous post, deep lakes in our area develop a thermocline in the summer, with relatively warm water near the surface (to approximately 25-30 feet) and relatively cool water near the bottom of the lake, with a zone of rapidly decreasing temperature (the thermocline) in between. The colder deeper water is more dense then the warmer surface waters and the thermocline in between limits the ability of the water in these two zones to mix. Generally, all plant life and plant growth occurs in the warmer surface waters, thus, producing oxygen (in dissolved format) for this zone. In contrast, in the deeper zone, no new oxygen is being added and oxygen is being used by bacteria as organic matter is broken down. These processes result in a fairly well oxygenated zone above the thermocline and an area of (sometimes extreme) oxygen depletion below the thermocline. The result is that the dissolved oxygen profile tends to be very similar to the temperature profile (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature and dissolved oxygen profile plots for August 1, 1991. The thin line at the top represents the water surface and the thicker line at the bottom represents the lake bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe oxygen profile just described sets up quickly on our lakes following the spring turnover period. Our Eagle Lake data does not include samples from early enough in the year to show the vertical mixing throughout the water column. However, Figure 2 shows the general pattern described above for all sample dates, but also shows the general tend that dissolved oxygen in the upper layer is higher in the early and late samples as cooler water can hold more dissolved oxygen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Dissolved oxygen profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also notice a peak in DO just above the thermocline on many dates. This is the result of hypersaturation of oxygen at that depth due to the temperature cooling faster than the oxygen can be depleted. Thus, for a period of time when the top of thermocline is getting deeper, the oxygen from the once cooler water will be higher than the now warmer water would likely contain (thus, being over- or hyper-saturated)."

    "text": "Seasonal Changes in Temperature Profile\nIn winter (under the ice in northern Wisconsin) and at ice-out the water temperature will be a nearly constant 39oF from top to bottom (perhaps a little cooler at the ice-water interface). However, as spring progresses the surface water becomes warmer and, moving into summer, that warmer water will extend deeper into the lake. However, in most lakes in our area there will be a depth where the water temperature begins to decline dramatically over a fairly narrow depth range (see Figure 1). Eventually there will be a depth where the water temperatures stays fairly and constantly cold below that depth. The transition zone of water temperatures quickly declining from warmer surface to cooler below-surface water is called the thermocline. As fall approaches the process is reversed such that the surface water will cool (and, thus, sink) until the water temperature is again fairly constant throughout the water column.\nOn Eagle Lake we do not have water column temperature data very near the ice-out and ice-in dates. Thus, the seasonal phenomenon just described cannot be fully illustrated for Eagle Lake. However, Figure 2 shows the general trend of warmer surface water, the thermocline, and cooler water at deeper depths through the open-water months. The warming and then cooling of the surface water layer is also evident in Figure 2. Finally, the dissolution of the thermocline in late fall was evident on the last observation date of October 16 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temperature profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020."

It was nice to get out for a quick hike, but we probably won’t do this one again (it is more interesting to hike up to the Broadway Cave)."

    "text": "On February 8, 2025 Kim and I hiked past the Praying Hands Rock via several trails, including the Praying Hands trail, off the First Water Road. The route was fairly flat along Jacob’s Crosscut Trail but began to climb while on Prospector’s View, Treasure Loop, and the start of Praying Hands trails. At the saddle near Praying Hands Rock we detoured to take a “social trail” behind a cut rock, which eventually required quite a bit of scrambling in loose rock (on some fairly steep areas) before reconnecting with the Praying Hands Trail. That sidetrack was fun, but probably not needed! The Praying Hands Trail back to the parking lot was a fairly easy gradual descent. Fun trail. Would do it again."

    "text": "On February 10, 2025 Kim and I hiked the western portion of the Superstition Ridgeline. We climbed to the Ridgeline trail via Hieroglyphics Trail and then turned west to Siphon Draw which we descended. We had a little trouble finding the trail at first (in retrospect, not sure how we missed it) and a few other places we had to search a little, but otherwise it was pretty easy to follow. The views were simply amazing, in all directions!! The only downside is that Siphon Draw is a tough descent when your legs are tired. This was a half of a bucket-list hike; we hope to do the East end (and visit Superstition Peak) next year."

The trail is fairly steep, but with many switchbacks, up to a “saddle” with a beautiful view. The trail then descends very steeply before climbing up the “back side” of the mountain to Picacho Peak. Several spots on this part of the trail were very steep, on smooth rock, or on the “edge” such that you needed to use the (very handy) cables for climbing. This was quite an adventure but well worth it for the 360o views at the peak."

Soon after the bridge, we left the Munger Trail on the Carlton Trail which generally follows along the St. Louis River. We did not have much time so we did a quick spur to the banks of the river and then followed the same trail back to the parking area. The trail along the river was very beautiful in places."
