The trail was fairly flat until the Wave Cave trail portion, which ascended quickly. The actual cave was larger than I expected and offered up some great photos. There were a decent number of people on the trail on this beautiful day. Details are below."

While he was a little snooty and often turned up his nose at “strangers”, he also melted your heart if he decided to give you the time of day. Here is a short piece that I wrote about Jem a few years ago.\nJem was taken from us way too early, though we know he is now with his “grandpa owner” taking walks, sitting on the couch together, and scheming to get those chippies.
