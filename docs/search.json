    "text": "Recently I have been considering the relative costs of propane and wood for heating our house. One of the considerations for propane is how the cost fluctuates from year-to-year and within a year. Most propane companies offer a “lock-in” price to protect against the supposedly inevitable increase in the cost of propane during the winter. I questioned whether this was a good investment or not (like many things, I suspected it was better for the propane company than me).\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has a website that shows the price per gallon of propane in Mont Belvieu, TX, as well as the wholesale and residential prices of propane during the heating season for a variety of regions and states. Both pages provide an option to download the data, which I did to play with below.\nFigure 1: My propane tank."

Thus, examining the price of propane at Mont Belvieu may indicate the basis for current and future propane prices locally.1 And this for a brief but interesting note about propane storage in Mont Belvieu.\nFigure 2 shows the daily price per gallon of propane at Mont Belvieu. There was a clear increase in price throughout the 2000s. Since then prices have varied, somewhat dramatically at times. Prices have dropped in the last year or so.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Daily propane spot price (per gallon) at Mont Belvieu, TX.\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots of average annual heating year prices (i.e., July to June) show the same basic trends – increase in the 2000s and more variability since then (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Annual heating year (July to June) boxplots of daily propane spot price (per gallon) at Mont Belvieu, TX."

Figure 4 shows the daily prices (per gallon) separately for each of the last 14 heating years (July to June) to more easily see inter-annual trends. My thought was supported in years like 2016-17 and 2020-21, but was not supported in many other years. Furthermore, I don’t see a consistent inter-annual trend among years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Daily propane spot price (per gallon) at Mont Belvieu, TX separated by annual heating year (July to June).

Landowners around the Pike Lake Chain expressed concerns about high water levels on the lakes soon after ice-out that year as “beaches” and docks were under water. A relative depth gauge is affixed to a permanent “wall” a few feet upstream from the dam on Flynn Lake (i.e., the outlet of the Pike Lake Chain). With the help of some friends (see Acknowledgments below), I now have near daily water level measurements at the gauge from May 2, 2023 to April 10, 2024. I hope these data will help us better understand both typical and atypical water levels on the lakes. My analysis and interpretation of these data are below.

Lake Mendota is a very large (9781 acres) and deep (83 ft maximum) lake that is approximately 350 miles south of Eagle Lake.

His general criterion was “complete ice out”; i.e., the lake completely devoid of ice with the exception of small remnants on north-facing shores.\nDates show above have been adjusted for leap years to maintain consistency across years. For example, Gary recorded ice out in 2024, a leap year, as 14-Mar but it appears as 15-Mar above to account for the extra “leap day” in Feb. In other words, 14-Mar is later in the year in a leap year then it is in a non leap year, which is accounted for above.

The loop begins with the Dutchman’s Trail and Brush Spring Trail that forms the end of the Cave Trail loop. I continued on the Brush Spring Trail through a pass into Needle Canyon. I then hopped on the Terrapin Trail to Bluff Saddle where I began the Weaver’s Needle Crosscut Trail. The first half or so of the crosscut trail is easy to follow but the last half requires some scrambling before a fairly quick descent to the Peralta Trail. I don’t think I followed a typical path but I could see the Peralta Trail and just navigated my way down it. I then returned on the Peralta Trail through Fremont’s Saddle and down to the Peralta Trailhead. This was a beautiful day hike that I will definitely do again."

    "text": "On February 23, 2023 Kim and I embarked on our first walk-through hike in the Superstition Mountains. Our “support team” dropped us off at the Peralta TH about 7am when it was 45oF. It was a pretty easy hike to Fremont Saddle, which we had done before. We then dropped over the saddle and continued on the Peralta Trail past the Needle to the Boulder Canyon Trail. It was neat to be so close to the Needle during this part of the trail. The Boulder Canyon Trail proved to be a bit challenging because the stream was fairly full of water and we had to cross it 25 times. Most crossings were pretty straight-forward, but there were several where we had to search up or downstream to find rocks close enough for both of us to cross. After our final crossing we climbed pretty steeply out of the canyon to get our first view of Canyon Lake and an awesome view back to the south of the terrain we had covered. A downhill hike to Canyon Lake Marina where our “support team” picked us up. We then went to Tortilla Flats for a beer and burger! My favorite part of this trail was seeing Weaver’s Needle from many different perspectives. All-in-all a fun trail that was 14.8 miles long and took us about 8.5 hours to complete."

It was nice to get out for a quick hike, but we probably won’t do this one again (it is more interesting to hike up to the Broadway Cave)."

The first third of the hike was snowy (but not too icy), but the remainder was mostly dry. The trail is more remote than the South Kaibab Trail that we did the previous day. The entire trail is beautiful but the last third after the junction with the Dripping Springs trail is especially gorgeous as it winds through a red canyon to the hut at Santa Maria Spring.\nWe were also treated along the way to a Bighorn Sheep. We initially spotted a single antler on a “shelf” about 50 feet above us. After several pictures of the antler, the sheep stood up and gave us a long and majestic side view. For some reason, the animal then quickly descended from the shelf to stop in the trail about 20’ ahead of us!! It stood there for a few minutes (as we slowly backed up) before moving across the trail to graze at the edge of a very high and sheer cliff. It was an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience.\nThis was a very fun hike!"

    "text": "On February 7, 2024 Cash and I walked the Bayfield Road Hiking Trail (official map) in the Brule River State Forest. The trails are combined for the first XX miles before the trails split with the Copper Range spur splits to the right. The Copper Range trail is partially on old road, railroad, or logging trail grades at times and “deer trails” in the woods at other times. The entire trail is well-marked (almost too much) with blue paint, blue markers, and some signs. The markings are easy to see but if you get in a groove walking one of the grades you may miss the turn back into the woods. The trail ultimately ends either at the Brule River or at a parking area at the end of Park Rd. There is a bridge on Park Rd so that you can access the campground on the opposite side of the river.\nAfter hiking back on the Copper Range Spur, we turned right to follow the Bayfield Hiking trail. Very quickly we came to a short spur to look down into the mine shaft, which is cordoned off with a fence for safety. Further along the trail is another short spur to an overlook with amazing views north towards Lake Superior. The trail back to the parking area passes by an old fire tower (which could be driven to as well).\nAll-in-all a nice scenic trail through typical northern Wisconsin woods, but with some cultural attractions.\nNote that I lost satellites during this hike, so there are portions of the trail that were not mapped properly."

FR448 looks to be an old railroad grade that is typical barrens habitat for the first (western) half or so before entering an area with some nice large pines before ending (to the East) in a large area that had been recently logged. FR449 is largely in typical barrens terrain but passes a small pond and an excellent high scenic overview. FR818 is more typical barrens terrain. Overall this was a beautiful hike with pretty easy walking (it could be driven with a good 4WD truck). Details are below."

There is also a steeply-ascending trail, the Dunning Springs Connector, that connects this area to the broader set of trails behind the Decorah Ice Cave."

    "text": "On 1-Feb-2024 Cash and I walked a loop of forest “trails” in the Barnes Barrens. Our walk began at Halfway Rd to head north on a counter-clockwise loop that crossed Moore Rd, Halfway Rd again, Moore Rd again, before ending back at Halfway Rd. Generally the “inside” of the loop appears to be being managed for a barrens habitat (logged, slash removed, and burnt) whereas the “outside” of the loop varied in habit from a typical barrens look to a mix of scrubby oak and pine to some rather larger (planted) pines. This was not an overly beautiful hike but I like the open view of the barrens landscape. We did not see Sharptail Grouse this day, but we have seen them when driving the section of Halfway Rd that bisects this hike. This hike was pretty easy walking (it could be driven with a 4WD truck). Details are below."

    "text": "We have not made this hike yet, but it would be a good hike to see the typical but awesome barrens landscape of the Moquah Barrens. The southern border of this loop is on a fairly well-travelled forest road, whereas the other borders are on much less-traveled more off-road type forest roads. There is a power and pipe line corridor that traverses the southern third of the area, but it is not overly distracting. You can start in any of the four corners of the loop, but the NE corner is least easy to reach by truck. I started this hike in the SE corner as there is an easy parking area just across from where FR406 meets FR242. Further details are below."

The views were stunning which made for an awesome little hike that fit our time in Santa Fe well. [It was also crazy for us flat-landers to be above 8000 feet!!]"

The climb up to the top was steep but the trail was fairly easy to navigate. We returned to the trailhead via the Black Mesa and Second Water trails. There were many more cacti no the trail back.

At that time we had very little experience and were navigating with a small map in a dated book. We completed the hike then but it was much more comfortable this time as we had more experience hiking in the desert and were using our Avenza. This is quite a beautiful trail, especially on the way down to and out of Hackberry Springs. My favorite part is the high bluffs along the stream."

The day was rainy so there were not many others on the trail. We did, however, “meet” some cattle grazing in parts of the trail that were not in the Superstition Wilderness. This was a fun hike."

    "text": "On February 25, 2023 I hiked to Robber’s Roost via the Carney Springs Trail (starting at the Lost Goldmine East TH) and returning via the Cave Trail. The climb up the Carney Springs Canyon got my heart pumping (~1300 feet elevation gain in a little over a mile). Finding the path into Robber’s Roost was difficult, but as I got closer I could hear voices and when I met the hikers outside of the Roost they offered to show me the “secret” passage into it (Thanks, Juan). It was amazing to stand in the Roost and the views out the fractures in the wall were beautiful. I returned through Fremont Saddle (a little less than a mile from the Roost) and down the Cave Trail, which had some navigational challenges as it did last year (I did not miss Geronimo’s Cave this year, though!). This was a challenging (the climb and some route-finding), but beautiful (views from on top, the Roost) hike that I will do again (with Kim)."

    "section": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality",
    "text": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality\nAs noted in the previous post, deep lakes in our area develop a thermocline in the summer, with relatively warm water near the surface (to approximately 25-30 feet) and relatively cool water near the bottom of the lake, with a zone of rapidly decreasing temperature (the thermocline) in between. The colder deeper water is more dense then the warmer surface waters and the thermocline in between limits the ability of the water in these two zones to mix. Generally, all plant life and plant growth occurs in the warmer surface waters, thus, producing oxygen (in dissolved format) for this zone. In contrast, in the deeper zone, no new oxygen is being added and oxygen is being used by bacteria as organic matter is broken down. These processes result in a fairly well oxygenated zone above the thermocline and an area of (sometimes extreme) oxygen depletion below the thermocline. The result is that the dissolved oxygen profile tends to be very similar to the temperature profile (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature and dissolved oxygen profile plots for August 1, 1991. The thin line at the top represents the water surface and the thicker line at the bottom represents the lake bottom.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe oxygen profile just described sets up quickly on our lakes following the spring turnover period. Our Eagle Lake data does not include samples from early enough in the year to show the vertical mixing throughout the water column. However, Figure 2 shows the general pattern described above for all sample dates, but also shows the general tend that dissolved oxygen in the upper layer is higher in the early and late samples as cooler water can hold more dissolved oxygen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Dissolved oxygen profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nYou may also notice a peak in DO just above the thermocline on many dates. This is the result of hypersaturation of oxygen at that depth due to the temperature cooling faster than the oxygen can be depleted. Thus, for a period of time when the top of thermocline is getting deeper, the oxygen from the once cooler water will be higher than the now warmer water would likely contain (thus, being over- or hyper-saturated)."

    "text": "Seasonal Changes in Temperature Profile\nIn winter (under the ice in northern Wisconsin) and at ice-out the water temperature will be a nearly constant 39oF from top to bottom (perhaps a little cooler at the ice-water interface). However, as spring progresses the surface water becomes warmer and, moving into summer, that warmer water will extend deeper into the lake. However, in most lakes in our area there will be a depth where the water temperature begins to decline dramatically over a fairly narrow depth range (see Figure 1). Eventually there will be a depth where the water temperatures stays fairly and constantly cold below that depth. The transition zone of water temperatures quickly declining from warmer surface to cooler below-surface water is called the thermocline. As fall approaches the process is reversed such that the surface water will cool (and, thus, sink) until the water temperature is again fairly constant throughout the water column.\nOn Eagle Lake we do not have water column temperature data very near the ice-out and ice-in dates. Thus, the seasonal phenomenon just described cannot be fully illustrated for Eagle Lake. However, Figure 2 shows the general trend of warmer surface water, the thermocline, and cooler water at deeper depths through the open-water months. The warming and then cooling of the surface water layer is also evident in Figure 2. Finally, the dissolution of the thermocline in late fall was evident on the last observation date of October 16 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temperature profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe winter of 2022-23 was exceptionally snowy in northern Wisconsin (see this). Landowners around the Pike Lake Chain expressed concerns about the high water levels on the lake soon after ice-out that year as “beaches” and docks were under water. A relative depth gauge is affixed to a permanent “wall” a few feet upstream from the dam on Flynn Lake (i.e., the outlet of the Pike Lake Chain). With the help of some friends (see Acknowledgments below), I now have near daily water depth measurements at the gauge from May 2, 2023 to March 28, 2024. I hope these data will help us better understand both typical and atypical water heights on the lakes. My analysis and interpretation of these data are detailed below. More information about my data collection is further below."

    "section": "Data Collection",
    "text": "Data Collection\nData collection is pretty straightforward for this project. I, or a friend, record the water level at the gauge to the nearest 0.01’ each day (as possible) as close to noon as possible. On the few days where we could not make the reading, I linearly interpolated the water level from the two adjacent readings. Surprisingly, it is harder to read the gauge then you would imagine. On a few days, we had multiple people read the gauge and from this I expect the “human error” of the readings to be about 0.01’.\nThe lake water level readings should be considered as “relative” values as it is not clear to me what the gauge is measuring from. In other words, a reading of 21” is not meaningful in and of itself (i.e. 21” from what?), but it does have meaning relative to another measurement of, say, 24” (i.e., it is 3” lower).\nPrecipitation measurements are from my data recorded for the CoCoRaHS Network at a location near the shore of Eagle Lake, the next lake upstream from Flynn Lake. Snow was converted to a “snow water equivalent” (SWE) to most closely compare with rain. Ice out was for Eagle Lake as recorded by Gary Hagstrom (see this)."

    "text": "Kim, Cash and I walked the trail along Glovers Creek in the Echo Valley State Park on 17-Sep-23. We accessed the trail from the Echo Valley Environmental Nature Trail and walked upstream to the Glovers Creek access parking lot. This was a nice walk along a trail that appears to be maintained for the trout stocking truck. This was a fun hike for me as I used to fish this section of stream as a kid, before the stocking truck trail was constructed. This section held many trout that had moved downstream from the stocking that (used to) stop further upstream. In fact, I caught my second largest Iowa trout in this section! I did not take any pictures – I will have to return!"
