    "text": "Recently I have been considering the relative costs of propane and wood for heating our house. One of the considerations for propane is how the cost fluctuates from year-to-year and within a year. Most propane companies offer a “lock-in” price to protect against the supposedly inevitable increase in the cost of propane during the winter. I questioned whether this was a good investment or not (like many things, I suspected it was better for the propane company than me).\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has a website that shows the price per gallon of propane in Mont Belvieu, TX, as well as the wholesale and residential prices of propane during the heating season for a variety of regions and states. Both pages provide an option to download the data, which I did to play with below.\nFigure 1: My propane tank."

    "text": "The winter of 2022-23 was exceptionally snowy in northern Wisconsin (see this). Landowners around the Pike Lake Chain expressed concerns about high water levels on the lakes soon after ice-out that year as “beaches” and docks were under water. A relative depth gauge is affixed to a permanent “wall” a few feet upstream from the dam on Flynn Lake (i.e., the outlet of the Pike Lake Chain). With the help of some friends (see Acknowledgments below), I now have near daily water level measurements at the gauge from May 2, 2023 to November 20, 2024. I hope these data will help us better understand both typical and atypical water levels on the lakes. My analysis and interpretation of these data are below. More information about the data collection is further below."

However, it was nearly 5” higher than the water level at ice-out in 2023-24 and was at least 3” higher than any other water level recorded in 2022-23 after the initial peak had subsided. Furthermore, the water level dropped rather quickly in spring of 2023 suggesting that there was excess water in the system that simply needed time to be flushed out.\nFrom 2022-23, it appears that, without any additional precipitation, lake water levels drop about 1/8” to 1/4” per day until a baseline level between 21” and 22” is approached. Near that baseline the drop in lake water level tends to be less. Lake water levels can increase substantially with precipitation but the actual rise does not always match the amount of precipitation, sometimes being more and sometimes being less than the precipitation amount."

    "text": "Data Collection\nData collection is pretty straightforward for this project. I, or a friend, record the water level at the gauge to the nearest 0.01’ each day (as possible) as close to noon as possible. On the few days where we could not make the reading, I linearly interpolated the water level from the two adjacent readings. Surprisingly, it is harder to read the gauge then you would imagine. On a few days, we had multiple people read the gauge and from this I expect the “human error” of the readings to be about 0.01’.\nThe lake water level readings should be considered as “relative” values as it is not clear to me what the gauge is measuring from. In other words, a reading of 21” is not meaningful in and of itself (i.e. 21” from what?), but it does have meaning relative to another measurement of, say, 24” (i.e., it is 3” lower).\nPrecipitation measurements are from my data recorded for the CoCoRaHS Network at a location near the shore of Eagle Lake, the next lake upstream from Flynn Lake. Snow was converted to a “snow water equivalent” (SWE) to most closely compare with rain. Ice out was for Eagle Lake as recorded by Gary Hagstrom (see this)."

For example, Gary recorded ice out in 2024, a leap year, as 14-Mar but it appears as 15-Mar above to account for the extra “leap day” in Feb. In other words, 14-Mar is later in the year in a leap year then it is in a non leap year, which is accounted for above.

We will see you again (Thanks Ronnie … beautiful song).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJordan\nKim and I got Jordan soon in 1991, soon after we were married. “Jordo” enriched our lives until March 2006. We miss the walks and boat rides.

    "text": "I hiked a loop that included Weaver’s Needle Crosscut trail on February 11, 2024. The loop begins with the Dutchman’s Trail and Brush Spring Trail that forms the end of the Cave Trail loop. I continued on the Brush Spring Trail through a pass into Needle Canyon. I then hopped on the Terrapin Trail to Bluff Saddle where I began the Weaver’s Needle Crosscut Trail. The first half or so of the crosscut trail is easy to follow but the last half requires some scrambling before a fairly quick descent to the Peralta Trail. I don’t think I followed a typical path but I could see the Peralta Trail and just navigated my way down it. I then returned on the Peralta Trail through Fremont’s Saddle and down to the Peralta Trailhead. This was a beautiful day hike that I will definitely do again."

    "text": "On February 23, 2023 Kim and I embarked on our first walk-through hike in the Superstition Mountains. Our “support team” dropped us off at the Peralta TH about 7am when it was 45oF. It was a pretty easy hike to Fremont Saddle, which we had done before. We then dropped over the saddle and continued on the Peralta Trail past the Needle to the Boulder Canyon Trail. It was neat to be so close to the Needle during this part of the trail. The Boulder Canyon Trail proved to be a bit challenging because the stream was fairly full of water and we had to cross it 25 times. Most crossings were pretty straight-forward, but there were several where we had to search up or downstream to find rocks close enough for both of us to cross. After our final crossing we climbed pretty steeply out of the canyon to get our first view of Canyon Lake and an awesome view back to the south of the terrain we had covered. A downhill hike to Canyon Lake Marina where our “support team” picked us up. We then went to Tortilla Flats for a beer and burger! My favorite part of this trail was seeing Weaver’s Needle from many different perspectives. All-in-all a fun trail that was 14.8 miles long and took us about 8.5 hours to complete."

It was nice to get out for a quick hike, but we probably won’t do this one again (it is more interesting to hike up to the Broadway Cave)."

We have done this trail previously but this time we started hiking clockwise from the overflow parking lot and then turned off on some “unofficial” trails rather than going through “the Garden” and returning on the Second Water Trail. We started midday on a beautiful Saturday, so there were lots of people out. However, there were relatively few people on the “unofficial” portions of our hike. All-in-all this was a fun hike on a beautiful day (and it is always fun to see Hackberry Springs)."

The views back to Lake James and into the Linville Gorge were amazing (the pictures don’t do them justice). This was a great hike with the newlyweds.

    "text": "Kim and I hiked the Hermit Trail of the Grand Canyon in Grand Canyon National Park from the rim to Santa Maria Spring on Feb 15 2024. The first third of the hike was snowy (but not too icy), but the remainder was mostly dry. The trail is more remote than the South Kaibab Trail that we did the previous day. The entire trail is beautiful but the last third after the junction with the Dripping Springs trail is especially gorgeous as it winds through a red canyon to the hut at Santa Maria Spring.\nWe were also treated along the way to a Bighorn Sheep. We initially spotted a single antler on a “shelf” about 50 feet above us. After several pictures of the antler, the sheep stood up and gave us a long and majestic side view. For some reason, the animal then quickly descended from the shelf to stop in the trail about 20’ ahead of us!! It stood there for a few minutes (as we slowly backed up) before moving across the trail to graze at the edge of a very high and sheer cliff. It was an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience.\nThis was a very fun hike!"

The trail was primarily wooded (so lots of welcome shade) with several waterfall views.

    "text": "On February 24, 2023 Kim and I hiked the Hackberry Springs loop (from the First Water TH) on a beautiful sunny day. This loop was one of the first hikes we did five or so years ago. At that time we had very little experience and were navigating with a small map in a dated book. We completed the hike then but it was much more comfortable this time as we had more experience hiking in the desert and were using our Avenza. This is quite a beautiful trail, especially on the way down to and out of Hackberry Springs. My favorite part is the high bluffs along the stream."

This trail is relatively flat but provides some great views of cacti as well as the sides and peaks of Turk’s Head and Superstition Ridge. The day was rainy so there were not many others on the trail. We did, however, “meet” some cattle grazing in parts of the trail that were not in the Superstition Wilderness. This was a fun hike."

    "text": "On February 25, 2023 I hiked to Robber’s Roost via the Carney Springs Trail (starting at the Lost Goldmine East TH) and returning via the Cave Trail. The climb up the Carney Springs Canyon got my heart pumping (~1300 feet elevation gain in a little over a mile). Finding the path into Robber’s Roost was difficult, but as I got closer I could hear voices and when I met the hikers outside of the Roost they offered to show me the “secret” passage into it (Thanks, Juan). It was amazing to stand in the Roost and the views out the fractures in the wall were beautiful. I returned through Fremont Saddle (a little less than a mile from the Roost) and down the Cave Trail, which had some navigational challenges as it did last year (I did not miss Geronimo’s Cave this year, though!). This was a challenging (the climb and some route-finding), but beautiful (views from on top, the Roost) hike that I will do again (with Kim)."

    "section": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality",
    "text": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality\nAs noted in the previous post, deep lakes in our area develop a thermocline in the summer, with relatively warm water near the surface (to approximately 25-30 feet) and relatively cool water near the bottom of the lake, with a zone of rapidly decreasing temperature (the thermocline) in between. The colder deeper water is more dense then the warmer surface waters and the thermocline in between limits the ability of the water in these two zones to mix. Generally, all plant life and plant growth occurs in the warmer surface waters, thus, producing oxygen (in dissolved format) for this zone. In contrast, in the deeper zone, no new oxygen is being added and oxygen is being used by bacteria as organic matter is broken down. These processes result in a fairly well oxygenated zone above the thermocline and an area of (sometimes extreme) oxygen depletion below the thermocline. The result is that the dissolved oxygen profile tends to be very similar to the temperature profile (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature and dissolved oxygen profile plots for August 1, 1991. The thin line at the top represents the water surface and the thicker line at the bottom represents the lake bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe oxygen profile just described sets up quickly on our lakes following the spring turnover period. Our Eagle Lake data does not include samples from early enough in the year to show the vertical mixing throughout the water column. However, Figure 2 shows the general pattern described above for all sample dates, but also shows the general tend that dissolved oxygen in the upper layer is higher in the early and late samples as cooler water can hold more dissolved oxygen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Dissolved oxygen profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also notice a peak in DO just above the thermocline on many dates. This is the result of hypersaturation of oxygen at that depth due to the temperature cooling faster than the oxygen can be depleted. Thus, for a period of time when the top of thermocline is getting deeper, the oxygen from the once cooler water will be higher than the now warmer water would likely contain (thus, being over- or hyper-saturated)."

The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round. Over the years, especially recently since Eurasian watermilfoil was introduced, volunteers have recorded various water quality parameters for the Pike Chain of Lakes. Below I show the record of temperature by depth recordings for one of the lakes (Eagle) that are publicly available through the Wisconsin DNR Citizen Lake Monitoring Network.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nMultiple temperature profiles can be constructed for each year since 2012.\nThe thermocline has begun to form by the earliest observations in May and is beginning to breakup in October (where those observations exist).\nThe top of the thermocline is generally between 15-20 feet deep in mid to late summer.\nThe bottom of the thermocline is generally between 25-30 feet deep in mid to late summer."

    "text": "Seasonal Changes in Temperature Profile\nIn winter (under the ice in northern Wisconsin) and at ice-out the water temperature will be a nearly constant 39oF from top to bottom (perhaps a little cooler at the ice-water interface). However, as spring progresses the surface water becomes warmer and, moving into summer, that warmer water will extend deeper into the lake. However, in most lakes in our area there will be a depth where the water temperature begins to decline dramatically over a fairly narrow depth range (see Figure 1). Eventually there will be a depth where the water temperatures stays fairly and constantly cold below that depth. The transition zone of water temperatures quickly declining from warmer surface to cooler below-surface water is called the thermocline. As fall approaches the process is reversed such that the surface water will cool (and, thus, sink) until the water temperature is again fairly constant throughout the water column.\nOn Eagle Lake we do not have water column temperature data very near the ice-out and ice-in dates. Thus, the seasonal phenomenon just described cannot be fully illustrated for Eagle Lake. However, Figure 2 shows the general trend of warmer surface water, the thermocline, and cooler water at deeper depths through the open-water months. The warming and then cooling of the surface water layer is also evident in Figure 2. Finally, the dissolution of the thermocline in late fall was evident on the last observation date of October 16 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temperature profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Pike Chain of Lakes near Iron River, WI is a set of nine connected lakes (Figure 1). The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round. Over the years, especially recently since Eurasian watermilfoil was introduced, volunteers have recorded various water quality parameters for the Pike Chain of lakes. Below I show the record of Secchi depth recordings that are publicly available through the Wisconsin DNR Citizen Lake Monitoring Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Satellite image of the nine lakes that form the Pike Chain of Lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Secchi disk is an 8-inch disk painted in quadrants with black and white that is lowered into a lake to assess water clarity. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is called the Secchi depth and is a measure of water transparency; the deeper the depth the more transparent the water. Water transparency can be a surrogate for water quality (more transparent generally means higher water quality) and can be an indicator of human activity on and around the lake. See this and this for quick introductions to Secchi disks.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nData was inconsistently recorded across lakes.\nMuskellunge Lake had the shallowest Secchi depth, whereas Lake Millicent and Hart Lake had the deepest (see Figure 2).\nAverage Secchi depth varied annually within each lake, with no clear trend of increasing or decreasing in most lakes (see Figure 3),"

    "text": "On September 7, I hiked most of the Dinosaur Ridge Trail before heading into Red Rocks Park to meet Kim on the Trading Post Trail. The Dinosaur Ridge trail was along a closed paved road (though some buses still drove it) that lead to many “exhibits” of dinosaur bones, tracks, etc. The exhibits were interesting, though, honestly, some of them took more imagination to see than I had. The hike over to Red Rocks had some relief until the highway, after which it was fairly flat. All-in-all a fun hike, but I will probably spend my time on other trails when we return."

    "text": "On October 9, 2024, Kim and I took the Gornergrat Bahn to the Riffelberg station (8471’), hiked from there to the Gornergrat station (10132’), and took the train back to Zermatt. The hike from Riffelberg to Riffelsee was beautiful with constant and amazing views of the Matterhorn and other “lesser” mountains. There were few people on this portion of the trail, though the area around Riffelsee was busy with people walking down from the Rotenboden station. From Riffelsee we decided to take a side trail rather then walk with all of the people on the trail from Rotenboden up to Gornergrat. This was a great decision as we did not see any people after Rotenboden until we got to Gornergrat and the scenery was breathtaking. Most of this trail was fairly flat along a steep mountainside above a valley carved out by a still existing glacier. The views of the glacier were especially spectacular as we started high enough to get the perspective of the entire glacier but ended up low enough to feel the awesomeness of it. Eventually we had to climb straight up (with the help of switchbacks) the mountainside to catch the ridge trail that led back to Gornergrat. This part of the trail was challenging to both our lungs and legs, but eventually led us into fresh snow and offered views of several mountain goats. The ridge trail at the top was snow covered with amazing views in all directions. Overall, this was a highlight hike from our time in Switzerland."

As such we decided to save the Gornergrat hike for the next day in hopes that the clouds would clear and we could see the Matterhorn. On this day then we began a hike in Zermatt that passed through Zmutt, Zmutt See, and Blatten before looping back to Zermatt. The hike up to Zmutt was classic Switzerland through woods, alpine meadows, and rustic areas with local’s cabins, while all the while hearing the dinging of livestock bells and the murmur of distant waterfalls. The trail back after crossing the Zmuttback was initially less interesting as we were on a downhill ski run. Eventually we left that and returned to a more woodsy and pastoral trail leading to the neat little towns of Zum See (we wished the restaurant would have been open, but we were off season) and Blatten. The trail after Blatten curled through some woods before crossing the river to return to Zermatt. This was a great trail to see the Swiss landscape on a rainy day. Unfortunately, we did not take a lot of pictures because of the rain."

The well-maintained wooden walkway is built into the side of the gorge. The hike through the gorge is short, but wonderful with several dramatic overhangs and sitelines that provide for great photos and movies. The views and feeling were well worth the admission price. After leaving the Gorge we had a short hike through the countryside and part of Zermatt proper to get back to our hotel.

From there we continued to climb until we reached an alpine meadow near Mittenberg. This area screamed “Sound of Music”, and the overlook to the north and west was stunning.
