This was a long walk for us (~12.5 mi) but offered stunning views of Weaver’s Needle from the north, which we had not seen before. The climb up to the top was steep but the trail was fairly easy to navigate. We returned to the trailhead via the Black Mesa and Second Water trails. There were many more cacti no the trail back. Fun hike. Details are below."

At that time we had very little experience and were navigating with a small map in a dated book. We completed the hike then but it was much more comfortable this time as we had more experience hiking in the desert and were using our Avenza. This is quite a beautiful trail, especially on the way down to and out of Hackberry Springs. My favorite part is the high bluffs along the stream."

    "text": "On February 23, 2023 Kim and I embarked on our first walk-through hike in the Superstition Mountains. Our “support team” dropped us off at the Peralta TH about 7am when it was 45oF. It was a pretty easy hike to Fremont Saddle, which we had done before. We then dropped over the saddle and continued on the Peralta Trail past the Needle to the Boulder Canyon Trail. It was neat to be so close to the Needle during this part of the trail. The Boulder Canyon Trail proved to be a bit challenging because the stream was fairly full of water and we had to cross it 25 times. Most crossings were pretty straight-forward, but there were several where we had to search up or downstream to find rocks close enough for both of us to cross. After our final crossing we climbed pretty steeply out of the canyon to get our first view of Canyon Lake and an awesome view back to the south of the terrain we had covered. A downhill hike to Canyon Lake Marina where our “support team” picked us up. We then went to Tortilla Flats for a beer and burger! My favorite part of this trail was seeing Weaver’s Needle from many different perspectives. All-in-all a fun trail that was 14.8 miles long and took us about 8.5 hours to complete."

    "text": "On February 25, 2023 I hiked to Robber’s Roost via the Carney Springs Trail (starting at the Lost Goldmine East TH) and returning via the Cave Trail. The climb up the Carney Springs Canyon got my heart pumping (~1300 feet elevation gain in a little over a mile). Finding the path into Robber’s Roost was difficult, but as I got closer I could hear voices and when I met the hikers outside of the Roost they offered to show me the “secret” passage into it (Thanks, Juan). It was amazing to stand in the Roost and the views out the fractures in the wall were beautiful. I returned through Fremont Saddle (a little less than a mile from the Roost) and down the Cave Trail, which had some navigational challenges as it did last year (I did not miss Geronimo’s Cave this year, though!). This was a challenging (the climb and some route-finding), but beautiful (views from on top, the Roost) hike that I will do again (with Kim)."

There were a decent number of people on the trail on this beautiful day. Details are below."

    "text": "Temperature Oxygen Relationship & Seasonality\nAs noted in the previous post, deep lakes in our area develop a thermocline in the summer, with relatively warm water near the surface (to approximately 25-30 feet) and relatively cool water near the bottom of the lake, with a zone of rapidly decreasing temperature (the thermocline) in between. The colder deeper water is more dense then the warmer surface waters and the thermocline in between limits the ability of the water in these two zones to mix. Generally, all plant life and plant growth occurs in the warmer surface waters, thus, producing oxygen (in dissolved format) for this zone. In contrast, in the deeper zone, no new oxygen is being added and oxygen is being used by bacteria as organic matter is broken down. These processes result in a faily well oxygenated zone above the thermocline and an area of (sometimes extreme) oxygen depltion below the thermocline. The result is that the dissolved oxygen profile tends to be very similar to the temperatue profile (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature and dissolved oxygen profile plots for August 1, 1991. The thin line at the top represents the water surface and the thicker line at the bottom represents the lake bottom.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe oxygen profile just described sets up quickly on our lakes following the spring turnover period. Our Eagle Lake data does not include samples from early enough in the year to show the vertical mixing throughout the water column. However, Figure 2 shows the general pattern described above for all sample dates, but also shows the general tend that dissolved oxygen in the upper layer is higher in the early and late samples as cooler water can hold more dissolved oxygen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Dissolved oxygen profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020."

The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round.

    "text": "Seasonal Changes in Temperature Profile\nIn winter (under the ice in northern Wisconsin) and at ice-out the water temperature will be a nearly constant 39oF from top to bottom (perhaps a little cooler at the ice-water interface). However, as spring progresses the surface water becomes warmer and moving into summer that warmer water will extend deeper into the lake. However, in most lakes in our area there will be a depth where the water temperature begins to decline dramatically over a fairly narrow depth range (see Figure 1). Eventually there will be a depth where the water temperatures stays fairly and constantly cold below that depth. The transition zone of water temperatures quickly declining from warmer surface to cooler below-surface water is called the thermocline. As fall approaches the process is reversed such that the surface water will cool (and, thus, sink) until the water temperature is again fairly constant throughout the water column.\nOn Eagle Lake we do not have water column temperature data very near the ice-out and ice-in dates. Thus, the seasonal phenomenon just described cannot be fully illustrated for Eagle Lake. However, Figure 2 shows the general trend of warmer surface water, the thermocline, and cooler water at deeper depths through the open-water months. The warming and then cooling of the surface water layer is also evident in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Temperature profile plots for six dates throughout the open-water season in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe dissolution of the thermocline in late fall was more evident in the data from 2020, where the temperature was almost constant throughout the water column on the last observation date of October 16 (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Temperature profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Pike Chain of Lakes near Iron River, WI is a set of nine connected lakes (Figure 1). The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round. Over the years, especially recently since Eurasian watermilfoil was introduced, volunteers have recorded various water quality parameters for the Pike Chain of lakes. Below I show the record of Secchi depth recordings that are publicly available through the Wisconsin DNR Citizen Lake Monitoring Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Satellite image of the nine lakes that form the Pike Chain of Lakes.\n\n\n\n\nA Secchi disk is an 8-inch disk painted in quadrants with black and white that is lowered into a lake to assess water clarity. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is called the Secchi depth and is a measure of water transparency; the deeper the depth the more transparent the water. Water transparency can be a surrogate for water quality (more transparent generally means higher water quality) and can be an indicator of human activity on and around the lake. See this and this for quick introductions to Secchi disks.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nData was inconsistently recorded across lakes.\nMuskellunge Lake had the shallowest Secchi depth, whereas Lake Millicent and Hart Lake had the deepest (see Figure 2).\nAverage Secchi depth varied annually within each lake, with no clear trend of increasing or decreasing in most lakes (see Figure 3),"
