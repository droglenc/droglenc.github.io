<p>Kim, <a href="../shelties.html#cash">Cash</a> and I walked the <a href="https://northshorevisitor.com/things-todo/fantasia-overlook-hiking-trail/">Fantasia Overlook</a> portion of the <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/">Superior Hiking Trail</a> near Silver Bay on January 10, 2025, while on our anniversary vacation. There had not been much snow yet this year so the hike was fairly easy on a crunchy snow pack. The view out to Lake Superior was beautiful as was the look inland over the small lake. This was a nice short out-and-back hike to get us “going” on our trip.</p>
