<p>On our trips to Iowas we will often stop at <a href="https://www.iowadnr.gov/locations/pikes-peak-state-park">Pikes Peak State Park</a> to let <a href="../shelties.html#cash">Cash</a> stretch his legs. One of my favorite loops is to start at the overlook of the Mississippi River and take Bridal Veil Falls Trail (I still haven’t seen the falls with water yet) to East Hickory Ridge Trail which we take out to another overlook of the river. We then follow the West Hickory Ridge Trail to the Weeping Rock Trail back to the parking lot. It is interesting that on the Bridal Falls and Hickory Ridge trails your can see (from a rspectful dstance) effigy mounds created by indigenous peoples.</p>
