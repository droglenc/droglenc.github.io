Water flowed continuously over the dam during this period.\n- Water levels fluctuated 6.5\", from a low of 1' 9.6\" (on August 16) to a high of 2' 4.1\" (on May 2).\n- The greatest daily change in water level was an increase of 2.4\" on July 27 following 1.16\" of rain. Interestingly lower daily water level increases were observed following greater amounts of rain on other dates.\n- In the absence of rain, water levels generally dropped between 1/8\" and 1/4\" per day (for the water levels observed in this year).\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/depth_series_wrain-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/delta_depth_series_wrain-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important icon=false}\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to Hal A, Ieuan A, Joe R., and Tim T. for taking the measurements when I could not!!\n:::\n",
