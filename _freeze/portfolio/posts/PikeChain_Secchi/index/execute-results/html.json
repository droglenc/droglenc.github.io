The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round. Over the years, especially recently since [Eurasian watermilfoil](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatic/plants/eurasian-watermilfoil) (@fig-EagleMilfoil) was introduced, volunteers have recorded various water quality parameters for the Pike Chain of lakes. Below I show the record of Secchi depth recordings that are publicly available through the [Wisconsin DNR Citizen Lake Monitoring Network](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/lakes/clmn).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Eurasion watermilfoil on Eagle Lake, early summer 2022.](Eagle_Milfoil.jpg){#fig-EagleMilfoil fig-align='center' width=67%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA Secchi disk is an 8-inch disk painted in quadrants with black and white that is lowered into a lake to assess water clarity. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is called the Secchi depth and is a measure of water transparency; the deeper the depth the more transparent the water. Water transparency can be a surrogate for water quality (more transparent generally means higher water quality) and can be an indicator of human activity on and around the lake. See [this](https://www.nalms.org/secchidipin/monitoring-methods/the-secchi-disk/what-is-a-secchi-disk/) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmRCh21SlFg) for quick introductions to Secchi disks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false}\n# Summary\n\n- Data was inconsistently recorded across lakes.\n- Muskellunge Lake had the shallowest Secchi depth, whereas Lake Millicent and Hart Lake had the deepest (see @fig-bylake).\n- Average Secchi depth varied annually within each lake, with no clear trend of increasing or decreasing in most lakes (see @fig-yrbylake),\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Lake Comparisons\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lakedata .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Characteristics of each lake in the Pike Chain of Lakes.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Lake             | Size (acres)| Max.
