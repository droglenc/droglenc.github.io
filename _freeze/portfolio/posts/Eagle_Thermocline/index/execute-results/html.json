The Pike Chain is highly developed, has several public access locations, and is popular among anglers, boaters, snowmobilers, etc. year-round. Over the years, especially recently since [Eurasian watermilfoil](https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatic/plants/eurasian-watermilfoil) was introduced, volunteers have recorded various water quality parameters for the Pike Chain of Lakes. Below I show the record of temperature by depth recordings for one of the lakes (Eagle) that are publicly available through the [Wisconsin DNR Citizen Lake Monitoring Network](https://apps.dnr.wi.gov/lakes/waterquality/Station.aspx?id=043077).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-warning icon=false}\n# Summary\n\n- Multiple temperature profiles can be constructed for each year since 2012.\n- The thermocline has begun to form by the earliest observations in May and is beginning to breakup in October (where those observations exist).\n- The top of the thermocline is generally between 15-20 feet deep in mid to late summer.\n- The bottom of the thermocline is generally between 25-30 feet deep in mid to late summer.\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Temperature Profile Plot\nA temperature profile plot shows the water temperature at various depths through the water column (@fig-ex1991). Depth is shown with the water surface at the top and the lake bottom at the bottom of the *left* axis. Temperature increases from left to right on the *bottom* axis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temperature profile plot for August  1, 1991. The thin line at the top represents the water surface and the thicker line at the bottom represents the lake bottom.](index_files/figure-html/fig-ex1991-1.png){#fig-ex1991 fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-ex1991 illustrates a typical mid-summer profile where the temperature is fairly and consistently warm near the surface (75-80<sup>o</sup>F from 0 to 15 ft) declines quickly over a fairly narrow depth range (drops from 75<sup>o</sup>F to 50<sup>o</sup>F from 15 to 30 ft) and then stays fairly and consistently cool at greater depths.\n&nbsp;\n\n## Seasonal Changes in Temperature Profile\nIn winter (under the ice in northern Wisconsin) and at ice-out the water temperature will be a nearly constant 39<sup>o</sup>F from top to bottom (perhaps a little cooler at the ice-water interface). However, as spring progresses the surface water becomes warmer and, moving into summer, that warmer water will extend deeper into the lake. However, in most lakes in our area there will be a depth where the water temperature begins to decline dramatically over a fairly narrow depth range (see @fig-ex1991). Eventually there will be a depth where the water temperatures stays fairly and constantly cold below that depth. The transition zone of water temperatures quickly declining from warmer surface to cooler below-surface water is called the *thermocline*. As fall approaches the process is reversed such that the surface water will cool (and, thus, sink) until the water temperature is again fairly constant throughout the water column.\n\nOn Eagle Lake we do not have water column temperature data very near the ice-out and ice-in dates. Thus, the seasonal phenomenon just described cannot be fully illustrated for Eagle Lake. However, @fig-ex2020 shows the general trend of warmer surface water, the thermocline, and cooler water at deeper depths through the open-water months. The warming and then cooling of the surface water layer is also evident in @fig-ex2020. Finally, the dissolution of the thermocline in late fall was evident on the last observation date of October 16 (@fig-ex2020).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temperature profile plots for nine dates throughout the open-water season in 2020.](index_files/figure-html/fig-ex2020-1.gif){#fig-ex2020 fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Eagle Lake Temperature Profiles\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temperature profiles separated by year (panels) and observation dates.
