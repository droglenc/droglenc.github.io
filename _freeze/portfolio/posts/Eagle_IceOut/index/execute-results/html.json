With the exception of a few notable years, the ice-out dates between these two lakes are quite similar. [Lake Mendota](https://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/lakepages/LakeDetail.aspx?wbic=805400) is a very large (9781 acres) and deep (83 ft maximum) lake that is approximately 350 miles south of Eagle Lake. The ice-out dates for Mendota are always before those for Eagle Lake, but they very generally track together.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Eagle Lake ice out dates by year with other lakes shown for comparison.](index_files/figure-html/fig-compare-1.png){#fig-compare fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Data Notes\nThese data were recorded by Gary Hagstrom. His general criterion was \"complete ice out\"; i.e., the lake completely devoid of ice with the exception of small remnants on north-facing shores.\n\nDates show above have been adjusted for leap years to maintain consistency across years. For example, Gary recorded ice out in 2024, a leap year, as 14-Mar but it appears as 15-Mar above to account for the extra \"leap day\" in Feb. In other words, 14-Mar is later in the year in a leap year then it is in a non leap year, which is accounted for above. Leap years are shown with triangles (rather than circles) in the time series graphs above.\n",
