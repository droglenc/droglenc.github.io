With the exception of a few notable years, the ice-out dates between these two lakes are quite similar. [Lake Mendota](https://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/lakepages/LakeDetail.aspx?wbic=805400) is a very large (9781 acres) and deep (83 ft maximum) lake that is approximately 350 miles south of Eagle Lake. The ice-out dates for Mendota are always before those for Eagle Lake, but the very generally track together.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Eagle Lake ice out dates by year with other lakes shown for comparison.](index_files/figure-html/fig-compare-1.png){#fig-compare fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n",
